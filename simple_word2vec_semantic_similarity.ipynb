Mikolov et al. [3] proposed the vector offset method to capture meaningful syntactic and semantic regularities [1, 2, 3, 4]. The Word2Vec, a word embedding technique in NLP, was introduced by Mikolov et al. [3].  Continuous skip-gram and continuous bag of words (CBOW) are two architectures of the word2vec model . The Skip-gram model was developed by Mikolov et al. [3] to learn high-quality distributed vector representation. This is useful for predicting the surrounding words in a sentence or a document.  However, the CBOW [3] is useful for predicting the current word based on the context. \n","\n","The value of Word2Vec is its ability to create vector representations of word semantics on which simple algebraic operations can be run. An example from Mikolov et al. [3] is that the “vector(”King”) - vector(”Man”) + vector(”Woman”) is very similar to the vector “Queen” [3]. In research, these word2vec models have been employed in study the relationship between words in documents and revealed biases based on gender and race, e.g. “Man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker?” [5], and racial biases “Black is to criminal as caucasian is to police” [6]. In this study, Word2Vec was employed in order to score the semantic similarities between the ground truth image labels (words for the target drawing) and subject predictions (the children’s responses). Word2Vec allows us to reduce the sources bias when manually scoring semantic similarities. It also creates a continuous scale which is valuable for regression analysis.\n","\n","In order to score similarity between the ground truth labels and subject predictions (Italian), all answers were manually translated into english. We then filtered words by their part of speech to create a Bag of Words including only Nouns, Proper Nouns, Adjectives, and Verbs. Words were then embedded using a word2vec model trained using the following corpus: OntoNotes 5, ClearNLP Constituent-to-Dependency Conversion, WordNet 3.0 (using spaCy [7], an open-source library for NLP, source: https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_lg). The ground truth labels consisting of individual words were also vectorized, then each word in the subject’s prediction was compared against the ground truth and the shortest distance was reported as the semantic distance of the subject’s prediction. Code to reproduce the exact analysis can be found in the supplementary resources.
